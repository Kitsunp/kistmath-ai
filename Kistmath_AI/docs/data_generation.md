# Kistmath_AI/utils/data_generation.py

This file contains functions for generating datasets of math problems.

## Classes

### MathProblem

- **Description**: Represents a mathematical problem with its solution, difficulty, and concept.
- **Attributes**:
  - `problem`: The problem string.
  - `solution`: The solution to the problem.
  - `difficulty`: The difficulty level of the problem.
  - `concept`: The concept involved in the problem.

## Functions

### generate_dataset(num_problems, stage, difficulty)

- **Description**: Generates a dataset of math problems for a given stage and difficulty.
- **Parameters**:
  - `num_problems`: The number of problems to generate.
  - `stage`: The learning stage.
  - `difficulty`: The difficulty level of the problems.

#### Example
```python
from Kistmath_AI.utils.data_generation import generate_dataset

# Generate a dataset of basic arithmetic problems
dataset = generate_dataset(num_problems=100, stage="basic", difficulty=1)
print(f"Generated dataset: {dataset}")
```
