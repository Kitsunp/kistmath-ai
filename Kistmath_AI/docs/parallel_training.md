# Kistmath_AI/training/parallel_training.py

This file contains functions for parallel training of the Kistmat AI model.

## Functions

### train_fold(fold_data)

- **Description**: Trains the model on a single fold of data.
- **Parameters**:
  - `fold_data`: A tuple containing model configuration, weights, training problems, validation problems, and number of epochs.
- **Returns**: A dictionary containing training history and updated model weights.

### parallel_train_model(model, problems, epochs=10, n_folds=3)

- **Description**: Trains the model in parallel using k-fold cross-validation.
- **Parameters**:
  - `model`: The Kistmat_AI model to train.
  - `problems`: A list of MathProblem instances to use for training.
  - `epochs`: Number of training epochs per fold.
  - `n_folds`: Number of folds for cross-validation.
- **Returns**: A list of dictionaries containing training history and updated model weights for each fold.

### reinforce_single(args)

- **Description**: Performs a single reinforcement learning step on the model.
- **Parameters**:
  - `args`: A tuple containing the model, problem, prediction, and true solution.
- **Returns**: The loss after the reinforcement step.

### parallel_reinforce_learning(model, problems, predictions, true_solutions, learning_rate=0.01)

- **Description**: Performs parallel reinforcement learning on the model.
- **Parameters**:
  - `model`: The Kistmat_AI model to reinforce.
  - `problems`: A list of MathProblem instances.
  - `predictions`: The model's predictions for the problems.
  - `true_solutions`: The true solutions for the problems.
  - `learning_rate`: The learning rate for reinforcement.
- **Returns**: A list of losses after reinforcement.
